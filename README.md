  Gatsby x Start Bootstrap Creative
</h1>

Gatsby implementation of [Start Bootstrap's Creative](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/creative/) template.

[**Demo Website**](https://johnjkerr.github.io/gatsby-creative)

## âœ¨ Features

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io)
- [Start Bootstrap Creative](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/creative)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [React Scrollspy](https://github.com/makotot/react-scrollspy)

## ðŸ‘€ Template Differences

Efforts have been made to keep the implementation as close to the source template as possible, however in adapting from jQuery to React there have been some changes.

- Scrolling to page sections uses the browser [`scrollTo`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollTo) function rather than a jQuery animation. This means that [browsers which do not support `scrollTo`](https://caniuse.com/#search=scrollTo) are not animated.
- The portfolio carousel uses React Bootstrap functionality for modal and carousel rather than Magnific Popup.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the starter project.
    
    ```sh
    gatsby new project-name https://github.com/JohnJKerr/gatsby-creative
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd project-name
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `project-name` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## ðŸ’« Deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/JohnJKerr/gatsby-creative)

### GitHub Actions x GitHub Pages

This project also contains an example of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) deployment to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). View the [`deploy.yml`](https://github.com/JohnJKerr/gatsby-creative/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) for the build definition.

The build process deploys to a folder rather than the root, and therefore uses the `--pages-prefix` flag in the build step and `pathPrefix: '/gatsby-creative'` in [`gatsby-config.js`](https://github.com/JohnJKerr/gatsby-creative/blob/master/gatsby-config.js).

#### Access Token

If you wish to use the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to GitHub Pages you will need to add an `ACCESS_TOKEN` secret to your repository

Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens to generate a Personal Access Token and add it to your account. The token will need the following permissions:

- repo
- read:packages
- write:packages

Make a copy of your token as you will not be able to access it again.

Return to your repository, go to settings and add a secret with the name `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

The Action will then deploy your site to `{your-github-pages-url}/{your-repository}`.
 
#### Not Using GitHub Pages?

If you do not wish to use GitHub Pages, simply remove the `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
